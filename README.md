ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed on the Titanic dataset to gain insights and prepare the data for modeling. The key steps included:

Data Overview: Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand the structure, data types, and summary statistics.

Missing Values Handling: Identified and treated missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Univariate Analysis: Analyzed individual features such as Age, Sex, Pclass, and Fare to understand their distributions.

Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between features and the target variable Survived using visualizations.

Outlier Detection: Used boxplots and statistical summaries to identify and handle outliers in numerical features.

Feature Insights: Identified key features influencing survival, such as Sex, Pclass, Fare, and Embarked.

Visualizations: Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for clear and informative plots.

This analysis helped in building a solid understanding of the dataset, forming hypotheses, and preparing data for feature engineering and model building.
